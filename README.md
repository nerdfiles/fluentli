## Marketing Revamp

### Problem case

Identify market and intersectional adoption scenarios.

### Strategy

Use Google Search trends and persona development through Mixpanel over microdata-
rich enhanced pages.

## Search Engine Optimization

### Problem case

Pages lack microdata attributes, but do possess generic Open Graph attributes.

### Strategy

Complement Open Graph metadatributes that is applied to markup with 
schema.org microdata attributes.

## Implementation

Must review dynamic template generation. Uses Ruby.

### Problem case

Some pages have data models which are used in the backend solution to the 
application; worst case: HTML is actually stored in the database. This is 
a conventional and inflexible architecture to serve lightweight templates.

### Strategy

Apply separation of concerns thinking to the refactorization of templates 
to achieve microdata-rich markup.
